# Module-3-Challenge

- Creating collectEmployees function
  Created an array
  Used a while loop to have the user answer prompts to enter employe data
  Used the isNaN to make sure the salary entered was stored as a number
  Pushed the prompt answers
  Added a confirmation that would end the while loop if it was false and returned the array.

- Creating displayAverageSalary function
  Used a for loop to add the salaries together
  Found the average of the slaries and console logged the average and the number of employees

- Creating getRandomEmployee function
  Used Math.random() to have it find a random index of the employee array created in the collectEmployees function
  Defined the name of the employee and console logged it!
